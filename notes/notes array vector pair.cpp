Array:
	Array is a non-premptive data type which is use to store homogenious type of data.
	- It allocate memory in contiguous order.
	- Size of array is non-dynamic.
	Syntex:
	
	Example:
		int arr[] = {12, 89, 34, 65};	// initialization and decleration
		int arr[5];		// decleration

Pointer:
	Pointer is a special type of variable which is use to store address of
	another variable.
	Syntax:
		data_type* pointer_name = & another_variable;
		
Doubly pointer:
	It is special type of pointer which is use to store address of another 
	pointer.
	Syntax:
		data_type ** pointer_name = & another_pointer

Array of Poiner:
	Array of pointer is use to store collection of addreses of another var.
	Syntax:
		data_type *array_name[ size ];

Vector:
	Vector is define as dynamic sized array.
		- It is a special type of array whose size can be change during runtime.
	Syntax:
		vector <data_type> vector_name;
		
	Some vector functions are following:
		1. push_back(): Add element to the end of the vector.
		2. pop_back(): Removes the last element from the vector.
		3. size(): return the number of element of vector.
		4. empty(): Return true if vector have no element and return false if vector
					 	have some elements.
		5. clear(): Remove all elments from the vector.
		6. at(): Access the element at the specified index.
		7. front(): Return the first element of vector.
		8. back(): Return the last element of vector.
		9. begin() and end(): return the reference of first and last element.
		10. swap(): swap all values of two vectors.
	
		
Pairs:
	pair is able to store more than one data type in a single unit.
	Syntax:
		pair <data_type_1, data_type_2> pair_name;
