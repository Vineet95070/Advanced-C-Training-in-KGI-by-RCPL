Access Modefier:
	This is a concept of c++, which define a scope of a data member and methods of a class.
	
	- there are four access modefier in c++, OOP's
	1. public:
		We can access public data member from entier the code.
	
	2. private:
		We can access private member only from parent class.
		
	3. protected:
		We can access protected member from the parent class and there child class.
		

Parent class:
	Parent class is a class being inherited from another class is called parent class
	- It also known as base class.
	
Child class:
	Child class inherit the property of base class.


Inheritance:
	When any class try to access property of another class then it is called inheritance.
	
	They are of five types:
		1. Single inheritance:
			When one class read the property of another class then it is called single inheritance.
			
		2. Multiple inheritance:
			When a child class access property of more than one parent class then
			it is called multiple inheritance.
			
		3. Multilevel inheritance:
			When class 'B' read the property of class 'A' and class 'C'
			read the property of class 'B' then it create a level wise 
			structure hence, it called multilevel inheritance.
			
				A
				|
				B
				|
				C
			
			
		4. Hierarchical inheritance:
			When more than one child inherit the property of single parent class
			then it is called Hierarchical inheritance.
			
			
		5. Hybrid inheritance:
			When More than one type of inheritance is present in a system than
			it is called Hybrid inheritance.
			
		
		- Dynamd problem:
			In c++ or any Object oriented programming have this issue,
			In which, A parent class is inherit more than one time for a
			single object.
			- This causes memory weste and overutilize.
			- To solve this problem we need to create virtual class.
