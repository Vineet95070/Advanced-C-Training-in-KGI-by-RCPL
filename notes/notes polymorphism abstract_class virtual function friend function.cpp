Polymorphism:
	The word polymorphism means having many forms. 
	- A person at the same time can have different characteristics. A man
		at the same time is a father, a hudband, and an employee.
		
	Polymorphism is of two type:
		1. Compile time polymorphism( Static Polymorphism ):
			When binding of method call with the method body happens at compile
			time then it is called compile time polymorphism.
			- It also known as earyly Binding.
			
			#Compile time polymorphism are of two type:
				1. Method Overloading:
					Methods having same name but different parameters is called method
					overloading.
					
				2. Operator Overloading:
					When one operator symbol is overloaded with multiple operations then
					it is called operator overloading.
					- Not all operators can be overload:
						- SRO( :: )
						- sizeof
						- member selector ( . )
						- member pointer ( * )
						- ternary operator ( ?: )
						
					
		2. Runtime polymorphism( Dynamic Polymorphism ):
			When binding of method call with the method body happens at run time
			then it is called run time polymorphism.			
			-Late Binding.
			
			#they are of two type:
				( i ). Method overriding:
					When method name and method parameter both are same then it is
					called method overriding.
					
				( ii ). Virtual Function:

Operator Overloading:
	When one operator symbol is overloaded with multiple operations it is 
	known as overloaded operator.
	
	- Not all the operators can be overloaded:
		Scope operator (::)
		Sizeof
		member selector(.)
		member pointer selector(*)
		ternary operator(?:)


Virtual function:
	Function define using virtual keyword is called virtual function.
	
	- When decleration of virtual function is present using '=0' then it is
	called pure virtual function.

Abstract class:
	When decleration of virtual function is present inside base class and
	definition of a virtual function is present inside child class then 
	the base class is called abstract class.
