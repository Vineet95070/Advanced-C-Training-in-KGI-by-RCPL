Stack:
	Stack is a linear data structure which follow last in first out mechanism.
	- It is a part of STL, It implemented using  class template inside <stack> header.
	- We can push() or pop() elements inside stack from rear side only.
	- Syntax:
			
			stack <data_type> stack_name;
			
	- Operations:
		1. push():
		2. pop():
		3. top():
		4. empty():	
		

Linked List:
	List is a collection of nodes, each node connected to there next node and each
	node having two data field, 1st one is data you want to store another one is 
	address of another node.
	
	- In stl list is define inside <list> header file.
	- It internally implemented using doubly linedList.
	
	Some functions of list are:
		1. push_back():
		2. push_front():
		3. pop_back():
		4. pop_front():
		5. clear():
		6. sort():
		7. reverse():
		8. begin():
		9. end():
		10. size():
		11. empty():
